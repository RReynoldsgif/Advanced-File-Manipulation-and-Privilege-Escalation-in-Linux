# Advanced-File-Manipulation-and-Privilege-Escalation-in-Linux

Advanced file manipulation involves more complex operations, such as modifying file permissions, ownership, and using advanced options with standard commands. Privilege escalation refers to gaining elevated access to perform administrative tasks that require higher-level permissions.


This screenshot highlights advanced file manipulation techniques and privilege escalation in a Linux environment. It demonstrates the creation and navigation of directories, file creation and copying operations (touch and cp commands), and changing file permissions. Additionally, it shows the escalation of privileges from user ‘alice’ to another user ‘bob’ using sudo, reflecting a comprehensive grasp of user roles and permissions management in Linux.

Advanced File Manipulation:

	•	Changing File Permissions with chmod:
The chmod command changes the file mode (permissions) of a file or directory. Permissions are represented by three sets of characters for the owner, group, and others (e.g., rwxr-xr-x). Numeric modes can also be used (e.g., chmod 755 file).
	
 •	Changing File Ownership with chown:
The chown command changes the owner and group of a file or directory. For example, chown user:group file changes the ownership to a specific user and group.
	
 •	Symbolic Links with ln:
The ln command creates links between files. A symbolic link (ln -s) is a pointer to another file, allowing multiple references to a single file.

 •	Using Wildcards for Batch Operations:
Wildcards like * (matches any number of characters) and ? (matches a single character) can be used to perform batch operations on multiple files or directories.

Privilege Escalation:

Privilege escalation allows a user to execute commands with elevated privileges. This is typically done using sudo (superuser do), which allows permitted users to execute a command as the superuser (root) or another user.

	•	Switching Users with su:
The su (substitute user) command allows a user to switch to another user account, provided they know the user’s password. For example, su - alice switches to user ‘alice’.
	
 •	Using sudo for Elevated Privileges:
The sudo command temporarily elevates privileges to execute a single command. Users must be authorized in the /etc/sudoers file to use this command. For example, sudo su - allows a user to switch to the root account.

Example Commands for Advanced Operations:

	•	chmod 644 file.txt: Sets read and write permissions for the owner, and read-only for the group and others.
	•	chown alice:developers project/: Changes the owner of the project directory to user ‘alice’ and the group to ‘developers’.
	•	ln -s /var/www/html /home/user/html_link: Creates a symbolic link named html_link pointing to /var/www/html.
	•	sudo apt-get update: Runs the apt-get update command with superuser privileges to update package lists.

By mastering these advanced file manipulation techniques and understanding privilege escalation, you gain more control over the Linux environment, allowing for efficient system administration and enhanced security management.
